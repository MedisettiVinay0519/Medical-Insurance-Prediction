# üè• Medical Insurance Premium Prediction (ML & ANN)

This project tackles the classic machine learning problem of **regression** by focusing on **predicting individual medical insurance premiums** based on health and demographic data. It provides a complete data science workflow, from in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to implementing and evaluating advanced models, including both a traditional **Machine Learning (ML)** model and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

## üéØ Goal

The primary goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can estimate the `expenses` (insurance premium) for an individual. This is a critical task for insurance providers for risk assessment and for policyholders for cost estimation.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Comprehensive Data Exploration:** Thorough analysis of feature distributions and categorical variables.
* **Feature Engineering:** Preprocessing steps including one-hot encoding for categorical data.
* **Advanced Modeling:** Implementation of both a traditional Machine Learning model and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Rigorous model assessment using key regression metrics: $R^2$ Score, MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

## üìà Data Visualization & Analysis

Visual analysis is crucial for understanding the dataset and model performance.

### Correlation Matrix & Feature Importance

The **Correlation Matrix** reveals linear relationships between all features. Notably, the strong positive correlation between the **Smoker** status and **Expenses** highlights its significance as a primary cost driver. The **Feature Importance Plot** confirms which variables have the largest impact on the final premium prediction.

## üß† Model Implementation

This project evaluates the predictive power of two distinct approaches:

### 1. Traditional Machine Learning Model

* **Model Used:** A **traditional Machine Learning Regression Model** (such as Linear Regression, Ridge, or Lasso) is used as an interpretable baseline to establish performance metrics.

### 2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

* **Architecture:** An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is developed using deep learning libraries like **TensorFlow/Keras**. This model is highly effective at capturing the complex, non-linear relationships often present in insurance data.
* **Structure:** The network includes:
    * An **Input Layer** accepting the preprocessed features.
    * Multiple **Hidden Layers** (typically with ReLU activation) for deep pattern recognition.
    * A single-neuron **Output Layer** (linear activation) for continuous value prediction.
